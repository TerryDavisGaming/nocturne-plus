# hub api v1

what the mod talks to. base address: `https://hub.nocturnbutbetter.com` (a qa build may use `http://127.0.0.1:8787`, the local stand-in). everything is under `/v1/`; inside v1 changes only ever add fields, so ignore fields you don't know. a breaking change would be `/v2/`, next to v1.

## conventions

- json in and out, utf-8. times are unix seconds.
- every request sends `User-Agent: NocturneButBetter/<version> (<BepInEx|MelonLoader>)` and `X-NBB-Client: 1`.
- every write (post, put, delete) MUST send `X-NBB-Client: 1`, and a body-carrying write exactly `Content-Type: application/json` (charset utf-8 allowed) or, for upload parts, `application/octet-stream`. anything else is 400 `bad_client`. `OPTIONS` is 405.
- keyed routes send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on that request only. public routes never need it (the server ignores it there).
- ids are lower-case crockford base32: packages `^[0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-z]{10}$`, uploaders `^u[0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-z]{12}$`, uploads `^up[0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-z]{16}$`. check them before using them in a path. versions are positive integers.
- the mod builds every url itself from the base address. the server never hands out urls to follow (apart from `legalUrl`, for showing).
- errors are always `{ "error": "<code>", "message": "<plain words>", ...extra }`, never cached. show `message` only for codes you don't know. every 429 carries both the `Retry-After` header and `retryAfter` (seconds) in the body.
- an answer that isn't json is one of cloudflare's own error pages. only the 1027 page (its body contains `1027`: the free plan's daily allowance is spent) means "too busy today, back after 00:00 utc". every other one (for example 1102, when one request went over its cpu or memory limit, or a 5xx page) means "the hub had a problem, try again later": it isn't a daily limit, so don't tell the player to wait for tomorrow. log the status code for qa.

codes the mod should know: `bad_client`, `bad_query`, `bad_request` (+`problems`), `not_found`, `method_not_allowed`, `no_key`, `bad_key`, `unknown_key`, `banned`, `revoked`, `not_yours`, `removed`, `deleted`, `unavailable`, `slow_down`, `daily_limit`, `rename_limit`, `bad_name`, `bad_reason`, `too_big`, `length_required`, `bad_part`, `upload_in_progress`, `upload_closed`, `busy`, `missing_parts` (+`missing`), `package_refused` (+`problems`), `battle_taken` (+`packageId`), `battle_yours` (+`packageId`), `battle_changed`, `removed_before`, `duplicate` (+`packageId`), `not_live`, `no_package`, `too_many_live`, `key_too_new`, `key_in_use`, `client_too_old`, `uploads_closed`, `closed`, `read_only`, `storage_full`, `busy_today`, `db_unavailable`, `not_set_up`, `server_error`.

## text rules (the mod applies the same ones)

every free-text field: nfc; remove c0 and c1 control characters (descriptions keep line breaks), u+00ad, u+034f, u+061c, u+115f, u+1160, u+180e, u+200b-200f, u+202a-202e, u+2060-2064, u+2066-2069, u+3164, u+feff, u+ffa0 and u+e0000-e007f; collapse whitespace and trim; cap in unicode code points: title 100, artist 100, author 64, pack title 100, description 1000, name 32, report note 500, song 100, difficulty name 32. a name must keep a letter or digit and can't be admin, owner, moderator or hub (ignoring case and punctuation). show server text with rich text OFF.

## public routes

### `GET /v1/info` (cached 5 minutes)

```
{ "api": 1, "hub": "nocturne+ hub", "minClient": "2.7.0", "uploadsOpen": true, "counts": false,
  "maxPackageBytes": 104857600, "maxUnpackedBytes": 209715200, "partSize": 8388608, "maxEntries": 1000,
  "maxSongsPerPack": 40, "maxThumbB64": 16384,
  "text": { "title": 100, "artist": 100, "author": 64, "packTitle": 100, "description": 1000, "name": 32, "note": 500 },
  "media": { "audio": ["wav-pcm","ogg-vorbis","mp3"], "pictures": ["png","jpeg","gif"], "video": ["webm-vp8"] },
  "message": "", "takedownContact": "dmca@example.org", "legalUrl": "https://hub.nocturnbutbetter.com/legal", "time": 1790380800 }
```

a mod older than `minClient` disables browse and upload. `counts` false means cards carry `downloads: null` and "most downloaded" should be hidden. `takedownContact` is the address the owner set on `/admin` for takedown requests and questions: show it in the rules before every upload. an empty string means it isn't set yet (show the `/legal` address alone then). `legalUrl` is always an https address (http only on the local stand-in).

### `GET /v1/packages` (cached 60 s)

parameters, all optional, IN THIS ORDER, each at most once, never empty, percent-encoded exactly like javascript's `encodeURIComponent` (spaces as `%20`). leave defaults out. anything else is 400 `bad_query`.

| parameter | values |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `battle` or `charts` (leave out for both) |
| `lanes` | `4` or `5` (leave out for both) |
| `uploader` | an uploader id: "more by this uploader". without `q` it's newest first only: `uploader` with `sort=popular` or `sort=title` and no `q` is 400 `bad_query` |
| `q` | the search text (below), at most 200 characters |
| `sort` | `popular`, `title` or `new` (`new` only together with `q`; without `q` the default is new, with `q` best match) |
| `cursor` | the `next` of the previous page, EXACTLY as it came, on the same list (same `kind`, `lanes`, `uploader`, `q` and `sort`) |

search normalization, done by the server on whatever `q` it gets:

1. unicode nfc;
2. remove the invisible characters of the text rules above (c0 and c1 controls, u+00ad, u+034f, u+061c, u+115f, u+1160, u+180e, u+200b-200f, u+202a-202e, u+2060-2064, u+2066-2069, u+3164, u+feff, u+ffa0, u+e0000-e007f);
3. lower-case with javascript's `toLowerCase` (the full unicode lower-case mapping, not only a-z);
4. split into words on anything that isn't a letter, digit or combining mark (the unicode general categories letter, number and mark);
5. drop words under 2 code points, cut each word at 32 code points, keep the first 4 words, join them with single spaces.

lengths count unicode code points, not utf-16 units. if nothing is left, the answer is 400 `bad_query` (so don't send `q` then). the server searches the normalized form whatever the client's own lower-casing did, so a client in .net's invariant mode (which lower-cases only a-z) still finds a search typed with accented, greek or cyrillic capitals. sending exactly the normalized form keeps the cache useful, since every different `q` is a different address. the last word also matches as a prefix when it has 3 or more characters. a search shows at most 192 results (8 pages of 24), taken from its best 200 matches.

answer: `{ "items": [Card], "next": "<cursor>" | null }`, 24 items a page. a cursor is opaque and signed by the hub: a made-up or edited cursor, or one used on another list, is 400 `bad_query`.

```
Card = { "id", "kind": "battle"|"charts", "version", "status": "live", "title", "artist", "author",
  "uploader": { "id", "name", "tag" }, "lanes": 4|5,
  "difficulties": [ { "name", "level", "notes" } ],
  "songs": null | [ { "song": "Firefly - 1", "difficulties": [...] } ],
  "battleId": "<guid>" | null, "size", "downloads": <int> | null, "createdAt", "updatedAt",
  "lengthSeconds": <number> | null, "bpm": [low, high] | null,
  "flags": { "gear", "level", "dialogue", "video" },
  "source": null | { "kind": "osu!mania", "mapper" }, "format", "requires": [feature names],
  "thumb": "<base64 baseline jpeg>" }   // thumb is left out if the owner refused the picture, or while it waits (see pictureState below)
```

title, artist, author, lanes, battle id, songs, flags and format come from the package file itself. difficulties, length and bpm are what the uploader declared: check them against the file after download. show NEEDS A NEWER MOD when `format` is above what the mod reads or `requires` names a feature it doesn't know.

### `GET /v1/packages/lookup?ids=a,b,c` (cached 60 s)

1 to 50 package ids, sorted, no repeats, commas not encoded. answer `{ "items": [...] }` in the same order:

- `{ "id", "status": "live", "version", "updatedAt", "title", "sha256" }`
- `{ "id", "status": "unavailable" | "removed" | "deleted", "version", "updatedAt", "title", "reason"? }` (unavailable means under review; `reason` only for removals, one of the removal reasons below)
- `{ "id", "status": "missing" }`

### `GET /v1/packages/:id` (cached 60 s, no query string)

a `Card` plus `"description"`, `"contents": { "files", "unpacked", "songs", "charts", "pictures", "videos", "json", "other", "mediaChecked", "mediaTotal" }` and `"file": { "size", "sha256", "fingerprint" }`. 404 `not_found`; 410 `removed` (+`reason`), `deleted` or `unavailable`.

### `GET /v1/files/:id/:version/package` (cached 1 day, no query string)

the package bytes, `application/octet-stream`, as an attachment. an older version keeps answering for 24 hours after a new one. 404, 410 as above. check, in this order: the size and the sha-256 against the detail; the zip rules and the fingerprint; every entry's crc-32 while inflating with caps; media by decoder; then the mod's own loader. only then move it into place.

### `POST /v1/packages/:id/installed` `{ "version": 3 }`

send once after a VERIFIED install. 204. counts a download (no key needed; 5 a minute per address).

### `POST /v1/packages/:id/report` `{ "reason", "note" }` with a key

`reason`: `copyright`, `offensive`, `picture`, `broken`, `malicious`, `spam`, `other`. the key needn't be registered. 201 `{ "status": "received" }`, 200 `{ "status": "already" }`, 400 `bad_reason`, 404, 429.

## keyed routes (always sent with `Authorization`)

the key is `nbbk1_` + 43 base64url characters (32 random bytes, no padding). the server stores its sha-256 (hex of the utf-8 key).

| route | answer |
|---|---|
| `PUT /v1/me` `{ "name" }` | 200 `{ "uploader": Uploader, "created": bool }`. registers the key at the first upload, or renames (once a day: 429 `rename_limit`). 400 `bad_name`, 403 `banned`/`revoked`, 429, 503 `closed` |
| `GET /v1/me` | 200 `{ "uploader": Uploader, "limits": { "probation", "probationUntil", "uploadsToday", "uploadsPerDay", "attemptsToday", "attemptsPerDay", "bytesToday", "bytesPerDay", "livePackages", "livePerKey" } }`; 401 `unknown_key`. `attemptsToday` counts every start of the last 24 hours, stopped and refused ones too |
| `POST /v1/me/rotate` `{ "newKeyHash" }` | 200; the old key stops working at once. only the new key's sha-256 travels. save the new key after the 200; if the answer is lost, try `GET /v1/me` with each key |
| `GET /v1/me/packages` | 200 `{ "items": [MyCard] }`: every status, up to 200 |
| `DELETE /v1/packages/:id` | 204; 403 `not_yours`; 404; 410 |

`Uploader = { "id", "name", "tag", "createdAt", "status": "ok"|"banned", "strikes", "trusted" }`. `MyCard` = a `Card` (with the thumbnail whatever its state) plus `"description", "removedReason", "removedNote", "removedAt", "pictureState": "waiting"|"shown"|"refused"`. a picture is `shown` the moment its upload finishes; it is `waiting` only when the hub's owner set a delay (`picture_delay_hours` above 0) or the owner refused an earlier picture of the same key (then it waits for the owner's ok), and `refused` when the owner took it down. its `status` is one of `live`, `hidden` ("under review"), `removed` or `deleted` (by the uploader).

removal reasons (`removedReason`, and lookup's `reason`): `copyright`, `offensive`, `malicious`, `spam`, `rules` (broke the hub's rules), `other`. show your own words for each and the owner's `removedNote` under them.

## uploading

1. `PUT /v1/me` at the first upload.
2. `POST /v1/uploads` (body at most 32 KB):

   ```
   { "clientUploadId": "<8-64 of A-Za-z0-9->",  "kind": "battle" | "charts",  "packageId": null | "<your live entry>",
     "file": { "size", "sha256": "<64 hex>", "entriesSha256": "<the fingerprint, 64 hex>" },
     "meta": { "description", "difficulties": [ { "name", "level": 0-99, "notes" } ],     // battles
               "songs": [ { "song", "difficulties": [...] } ],                            // packs: the manifest's songs
               "lengthSeconds", "bpm": [low, high], "requires": [] },
     "thumb": "<base64 baseline jpeg, at most 16384 characters, at most 256 px>",
     "rightsConfirmed": true, "client": "2.7.0" }
   ```

   201 `{ "uploadId", "packageId", "version", "partSize": 8388608, "parts", "expiresAt" }`. the same `clientUploadId` again while open gives 200 and the same body. errors: 400 `bad_request` (+`problems`), 401, 403 `banned`/`not_yours`/`key_too_new`/`client_too_old`, 404 `no_package`, 409 `upload_in_progress`/`not_live`/`too_many_live`, 409 `duplicate` (+`packageId`: another entry already has these files, by `entriesSha256`; say so before any part is sent), 413 `too_big`, 429 `slow_down`/`daily_limit` (+`retryAfter`), 503 `uploads_closed`/`storage_full`/`read_only`. a new version of your own entry may keep the same files (to change its description or picture).
3. `PUT /v1/uploads/:u/parts/:n` for n = 1 to `parts`, one after another, raw bytes with an exact `Content-Length`: `partSize`, or the rest for the last part. 200 `{ "n", "etag" }`; 400 `bad_part` (a wrong length, or for a one-part upload bytes that don't match `sha256`), 409 `upload_closed` (also when the upload was stopped or expired while the part was arriving), 411, 413, 503 `storage_full`. a part that fails can be sent again (3 tries: after 1 s, then 5 s).
4. `POST /v1/uploads/:u/complete` (body `{}`): 200 `{ "packageId", "version", "status": "live" }`. safe to repeat: a repeat returns the stored answer. 409 `missing_parts` (+`missing`), 409 `busy` (a complete is running; retry after `retryAfter`), 422 `package_refused` (+`problems`, plain words to show), 409 `battle_taken`/`battle_yours`/`battle_changed`/`removed_before`/`duplicate`/`not_live`.
5. `DELETE /v1/uploads/:u` stops an upload (204).

an upload with no part for 15 minutes, or no new part for an hour, expires.

limits: one open upload per key; a key's first 48 hours: 2 uploads and 100 MB a day, then 10 uploads and 500 MB a day; 3 starts a day for each upload a key may finish (stopped and refused starts count too); 50 live entries per key. per address (an ipv4 address, or an ipv6 /56 for new keys and /64 for reports): 20 new keys and 50 reports a day. all are `daily_limit` with `retryAfter`, and the owner can change them.

## the package rules the server checks at complete

the mod's builder must produce packages that pass these, and the mod checks the same (and more) on every download.

- a zip that starts with `PK\3\4` at byte 0 and ends with its end record: no comment, one disk, no zip64, at most 1000 entries, a file list of at most 1 MB that ends where the end record starts.
- each entry: not encrypted; stored or deflate; version needed at most 2.0; no entry comment; NO EXTRA FIELD IN ITS LOCAL HEADER (the central directory may have one, but never zip64); a stored entry's sizes equal; a declared size a deflate stream can actually reach; no overlap. the overlap walk sorts entries by local header offset, and each entry's end is offset + 30 + local name length + local extra length + compressed size (+ 16 with a data descriptor, flag bit 3), read from the LOCAL header, which must be at most the next entry's offset (and the central directory's for the last one). a local extra field moves an entry's data without the directory saying so, which is how one entry's data can be made to cover the next ("extra-field quoting"), so the client refuses it too.
- names: utf-8 (flag bit 11) or plain ascii; none of `\ : < > " | ? *`, control, bidi or invisible characters; no leading `/`; no empty, `.` or `..` part; no part ending in a dot or a space; no device names (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM0-9`, `LPT0-9`, and `COM`/`LPT` with superscript digits, with or without an extension); at most 200 characters and at most 6 folders deep; no two names the same ignoring case.
- a battle: `battle.json` at the root or inside its ONE top folder, and every entry inside that folder. a pack: `manifest.json` at the root.
- extensions: battles `json sm ogg wav mp3 png jpg jpeg gif webm`, packs `json sm`.
- per file (by the name inside the folder): json 1 MB, sm 8 MB, pictures 16 MB (32 MB under `art/`, 4 MB under `portraits/`), anything else 512 MB; 200 MB unpacked in all.
- `battle.json` / `manifest.json`: at most 256 KB, strict json (no comments, no trailing commas), matching its crc-32. keys are read ignoring case.
  - battles: `format` 2, `kind` "battle", `id` a guid (lower-cased), a `title`, `lanes` 4 or 5, `audio` naming the song file (an `.ogg`, `.wav` or `.mp3` in the package; the mod plays whatever file `audio` names, so it must be one whose bytes are checked), and `card`, when present and not empty, naming a `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.gif` in the package. names are compared ignoring case, with `\` read as `/`. flags: `gear` is an object with mode "set", `level` is a number or an object with mode "set" and a value, `dialogue` is present, `video` when a `.webm` sits under `art/`.
  - packs: `format` 1, a `title`, `lanes` 4 or 5, and `charts[]` whose `source` is "game" and whose `file` is in the zip. at most 40 songs. `meta.songs` must name exactly the manifest's songs.
- media by decoder, from the bytes: audio must be pcm or float wav (format 1 or 3, or extensible with those), ogg whose first packet is vorbis, or mp3; pictures png, jpeg or gif; video webm (doctype "webm") whose video track is `V_VP8`. at most 16 song and video files. the server checks every song and video and as many pictures as a small read budget allows (`contents.mediaChecked` of `mediaTotal`); the mod checks all of them.
- every `.sm` and `.json` file must hold text: its first 64 bytes (unpacked) have no nul or other control character besides tab, line feed and carriage return, and don't start like a sound, picture or video (`RIFF`, `OggS`, `fLaC`, `FORM`, `ID3`, an mp4 box type such as `ftyp` at byte 4, asf, ebml, an mpeg or adts frame sync, png, jpeg, `GIF8`). the builder should write the `.sm` and `.json` files next to each other (for example sorted by name), since the server reads them in a few windows and refuses a package whose text files are too spread out to read.
- THE CLIENT'S MEDIA CHECK MUST FOLLOW WHAT THE LOADER WILL DECODE, NOT FILE NAMES. the mod picks a decoder from a file's bytes, and a file can be reached by name from battle.json (`audio`, `card`), from enemy and enemy art files, from dialogue portraits and from a chart's `#MUSIC`. so check every file those name by its bytes, whatever its extension, and check every entry of every type by its bytes before installing anything.
- the fingerprint below must equal `entriesSha256`.

## the fingerprint

sha-256 (lower-case hex) of one line per central directory entry, `<name>\0<uncompressed size>\0<crc-32 as 8 lower-case hex>\n`, with the name exactly as stored and the size in decimal. sort the lines by the name with only `A`-`Z` lowered, comparing utf-16 code units (ordinal). it depends only on names, sizes and crcs, never on how the deflate stream came out.

## the thumbnail

a baseline jpeg (sof0) of at most 256 by 256 px, at most 20 segments before its scan, ending with eoi, at most 16384 characters of base64. the server reads its markers and never decodes it; show it only through the game's own `LoadImage` after the same check. the hub shows an uploader's thumbnail at once, with no review (unless the owner set a delay), so these checks and the owner's refuse button are all that stand between an upload and the listing.
